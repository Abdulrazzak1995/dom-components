examples and exercises to practice writing DOM component functions.

in each exercise or example, there is a function to write and test cases. the test cases are plain JavaScript objects with matching properties to your expected DOM component.  These test cases are very similar, but similar, to what you see when you `console.log` or `console.dir` your DOM components.

## Examples

* [live test page](./examples/index.html)
* [source: simple hyperlink](./examples/simpleHyperLink.js)
* [source: header with link](./examples/headerWithLink.js)
* [source: zero-ordered list](./examples/zeroOrderedList.js)

## Exercises

* [live test page](./index.html)
* [source: linked button](./exercises/linked-buttom.js)
* [source: thumbnail](./exercises/thumbnail.js)
* [source: linked thumbnail](./exercises/linked-thumbnail.js)
* [source: study links](./exercises/study-links.js)

## Study Tips

To get the most out of these exercises, it's best to have your devtools open and docked to the right of your screen.  This will make it easier to compare the test results to the inspected DOM, and to the logged components
